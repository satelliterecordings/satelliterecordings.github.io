#Reduced prices on bandcamp


Considering current economic situations, I reduced prices some of my works on Bandcamp. This change will continue unless there is a sudden change in the situation.


- Heart - no change

-$12 Kaleidoscope - dropped down to $9.99
--All $2.0 singles included in Kaleidoscope - dropped down to $1.5
--$1.0 What are you dreaming of? - dropped down to $0.7USD 

-$4 Oblivion - no changes

-$1.5 Dandelion - $1.2
